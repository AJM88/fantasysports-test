# FantasySports Frontend Test

Project develop as a technical test for FantasySports.

Demo: http://fantasysports-test.alvarojimenezmartin.com/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Quick Overview

To run the project locally. Firts install dependencies:
### `npm install` or `yarn install`

And then start local server:
### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`
Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
